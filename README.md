**Note:** Those technologies are added to the project 
using CDN links in the index.html file, if you prefer,
you can import these with npm. 


## The good news

1. It supports spanish/English output if you follow
the html structure.

## How to deploy it?

1. Download as a zip or clone the repository in your local directory.
2. Go to the folder and open index.html file in any browser. 
3. Enjoy


## You can use it as a template?

I didn't it as a template because it's more like a personal project
but... **Of course you can!** 

Even more, if you have some questions, 
you can write me to my personal email dj.bautista10@uniandes.edu.co

I will try to make this project more clean in the next days yo, yup...
sorry the mess :)
